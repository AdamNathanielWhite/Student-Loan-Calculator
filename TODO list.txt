2. (skip) extra payments. If getWorstLoanIndex does not have a bug, then the bug is in the extra payments. 
3. Different repayment plans, besides standard. 
4. Deferment - subsidized vs unsubsidized. Add a checkbox for each loan. See scenarioGenerator.js --> getLoanPaymentInformation --> deferment
5. career forgiveness

OTHER
