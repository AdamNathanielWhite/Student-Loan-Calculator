TODO for Student Loan Calculator

CODE
1. (skip) getWorstLoanIndex. build a test bench. Why is the total of payments not changing sometimes?
2. (skip) extra payments. If getWorstLoanIndex does not have a bug, then the bug is in the extra payments. 
3. What does the $50 minimum apply to? Per loan, or total?? (research)
4. remove loan from list when edit button is clicked. Update future.
5. Different repayment plans, besides standard
6. Deferment - subsidized vs unsubsidized. Add a checkbox for each loan. See scenarioGenerator.js --> getLoanPaymentInformation --> deferment

OTHER
1. (short on time) Print data into a table
2. Graphs, possibly using R Shiny
