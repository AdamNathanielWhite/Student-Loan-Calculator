TODO for Student Loan Calculator

CODE
1. (skip) getWorstLoanIndex. build a test bench. Why is the total of payments not changing sometimes?
2. (skip) extra payments. If getWorstLoanIndex does not have a bug, then the bug is in the extra payments. 
2. Add loan before clicking submit. NaN shows up.
3. Different repayment plans, besides standard. 
4. remove loan from list when edit button is clicked. Update future.
5. Deferment - subsidized vs unsubsidized. Add a checkbox for each loan. See scenarioGenerator.js --> getLoanPaymentInformation --> deferment

OTHER
1. (short on time) Print data into a table
2. Graphs, possibly using R Shiny
