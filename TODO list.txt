TODO for Student Loan Calculator

CODE
1. (skip) getWorstLoanIndex. build a test bench. Why is the total of payments not changing sometimes?
2. (skip) extra payments. If getWorstLoanIndex does not have a bug, then the bug is in the extra payments. 
6. (bug) Input finish date 20 years into the future. standard payment is calculated from the wrong date. 

OTHER
1. (short on time) Print data into a table
2. Graphs, possibly using R Shiny
