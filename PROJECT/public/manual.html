	        <h2>I. Inputs</h2>
	        
	        <h3>1. Repayment Plan</h3>
	        <p>There are currently 5 different federal student loan repayment plans. 
	        You can find out which plan you are currently on and your completion date by signing in to <a target="_blank" href="https://myfedloan.org/">myfedloan.org</a>
	        </p>
	        
	        <h3>2. Income</h3>
	        <p>Enter your approximate income. This is used to calculate whether you are eligible for loan forgiveness based on income amounts.</p>
	        
	        <h3>3. State</h3>
	        <p>Your state of residency is also used to calculate loan forgiveness. Since the cost of living is higher in Alaska and Hawaii, the maximum income to be eligible for loan forgiveness is greater in these states.</p>
	        
	        <h3>4. Career forgiveness</h3>
	        <p>If you may receive loan forgiveness due to your chosen career track, input the number of years from today that you are expected to wait before loans are forgiven.</p>
	        
	        <h3>5. Extra payments</h3>
	        <p>Paying extra money each month above the minimums is the best way to save money and time on your student loans. 
	        Either specify a fixed extra amount to pay from now until completion, or click and drag the points on the second graph to change payment amounts over time.</p>
	        
	        <h3>6. Refinance option</h3>
	        <p>If you are considering refinancing your loans in the near future, input the terms of the loan here. You'll be able to compare the loans side by side in the graph</p>
	        
	        <h3>7. Autopay</h3>
	        <p>By using autopay, your loan interest rates will be reduced by 0.25%.</p>
	        
	        <h3>8. Payoff order</h3>
	        <p>There are several different strategies for paying off multiple loans early. Your extra monthly payment will always go toward one loan,
	        until it is completely paid off. Then those combined payments will both go to the second loan, and so on until all loans are gone. 
	        By paying the loan with the highest rate first (Avalanche), you will save the most money, although it may be a minor amount in most cases. 
	        The Snowball method will be easier to follow, since progress is easier to visualize. 
	        Read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/snowballs-or-avalanches-which-debt-reduction-strategy-is-best-for-you">this</a> article for a more in-depth description.</p>
	        
	        <h3>9. New repayment plan</h3>
	        <p>If you are considering switching to a new repayment plan, select it here. The graph will show you the differences between both repayment plans.</p>
	        
	        <h2>II. Loans</h2>
	        
	        <p>Input all loans that you currently hold. You can find this information at <a target="_blank" href="https://myfedloan.org/">myfedloan.org</a>. Note that the rate is the APR rate. Remove a loan by clicking the 'Edit' button.</p>
	        
	        <h2>III. Graphs</h2>
	        
	        <h3>Scenario graph</h3>
	        
	        <p>In the graph, you will see several different 'scenarios' displayed. Each plotted line represents one scenario. Time is on the x-axis, and amount of loans remaining is on the y-axis.</p>
	        
	        <h3>Payment graph</h3>
	        
	        <p>As input above, the second graph shows you each monthly payment for the life of your loans. Click and drag the points on the graph to change payback amounts for different months.</p>
